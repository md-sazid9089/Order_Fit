# Backend implementation progress

## P0 — contract freeze (15 October 2026)

Scope: P0 only. No P1 migration, auth/session service, repository, worker, document
storage implementation or business endpoint was implemented. The application
engine and language/workflow scaffolds remain later-phase work. No earlier P0
completion was assumed or recovered.

### Checkout reconciliation

- Starting branch: `backend/initial`; HEAD `d71f5465cce1938845827d0df80ca2431ef10d34`.
- Initially untracked user-provided files: root `AGENTS.md`, `backend/AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/initial_backend_implementation_plan.md`. Read and preserved all three;
  no existing progress file, contract package, generated API types or uv.lock.
- Read the plan in full, both applicable instruction files, actual schema/guards/
  grants/reference data/migration boundary, scaffold modules/tests/configuration,
  reference semantics and current database connection guide.
- The plan's audited `a0608e6` is an ancestor of HEAD. Committed changes since it
  are environment/ignore files and database documentation. SQL and application
  files are unchanged across that range. This does not validate historical tests.
- Stayed on the existing branch. Did not reset, clean, switch branches, rewrite
  history or contact configured/shared databases. Supplied instruction/plan files
  are included in the requested P0 commit without rewriting their contents.

### Actual deliverables and decisions

| Files | Actual change |
|---|---|
| `backend/orderfit/contracts/primitives.py` | Strict wire money/BIGINT IDs, business dates, UTC instants, currencies, roles, revision and pagination primitives; numeric/boolean literals cannot coerce |
| `contracts/financial.py` | Complete confirmed snapshots, evidence/source roles, costs, supported loan terms, owner policy/strategy/scenarios, sensitivity; duplicate/anchor/grid/aggregate/full-horizon/work/coverage validation |
| `contracts/resources.py`, `workflow.py`, `language.py` | Draft/read/write/upload/import/auth/job/result/approval/action/execution/export DTOs; blocked outcomes separate from numeric results; typed language proposals only |
| `contracts/protocol.py` | Frozen snapshot/bundle canonicalization, secret-aware keyed request fingerprints, freshness/expiry predicates, state/permission/SQLSTATE contracts; no competing audit-chain format |
| `contracts/configuration.py` | Explicit settings contract, live-mode fail-closed validation, safe origins, selected Argon2id parameters; strict runtime startup wiring remains P1 |
| `contracts/catalogue.py`, `export.py` | 101 target operations with method/path, request/response, permission, service/storage owner, implementation phase and V-test gate; offline deterministic export, never mounted mock success |
| `docs/contracts/openapi.json`, `frontend-api.d.ts`, `typecheck.ts` | Generated OpenAPI 3.1/frontend types plus positive/negative TypeScript consumer examples |
| `docs/contracts/README.md`, `capability-ownership.md`, `db-gap-dispositions.md`, `state-action-matrix.md` | Source/decision matrix; supported/deferred list; full DB-01–DB-30 dispositions; DB-to-snapshot-to-engine/result mapping; transport/null/unit/idempotency/permission/source/loan/action rules |
| ADRs `0007`, `0008`, `0009` | Accepted P0 contracts for eight-state runner, snapshots/exact approval bundles and restricted roles/sessions; clearly distinguish acceptance of design from implementation |
| `backend/tests/contracts/` | Executable valid/invalid/stale/missing/security cases and synthetic canonical snapshot/bundle byte/hash fixtures; no seeded credentials or provider traffic |
| `backend/pyproject.toml`, `.python-version`, `uv.lock` | Python 3.12 target, locked runtime/dev graph, OpenAI 2.54.0, argon2-cffi 25.1.0; removed unused LangGraph dependencies; pinned isolated build backend/transitive build constraints |
| Dockerfile, Compose, CI, environment templates, README | Frozen uv installs; explicit separate migrator/runtime credential injection; no entire developer env injected into API; CI contract generation/validation/typecheck; development commands and honest current status |
| `config.py`, API/schema and agent docstrings, database guide status note | Disable automatic developer env loading and privileged URL fallback; current P0 contracts supersede unsafe historical examples; existing unimplemented functions remain explicitly scaffolded |
| `.gitignore`, tracked `.env`/`backend/.env` removal | Ignore credentials while preserving example files; removed both secret files from the index with local file hashes compared before/after, byte-for-byte unchanged |

Financial resolutions are explicit, with no pending financial TODO in the P0
contracts. Supplier cost quotes are not customer revenue quotes. Only positive-grid
flat term loans with explicit fee timing/availability are supported; no APR or
generated-limit-as-approval assumption. Unsupported active policies/late penalties
are rejected. Full horizon includes late financing/repayments and scan endpoints;
coverage gaps require acknowledgement. Finite scan success never means proven
nonpayment survival. Existing immutable evaluations/options/approvals/actions,
cash events, identity objects and PostgreSQL audit canonicalization remain owners.

Coarse business revisions deliberately invalidate more results to simplify safety.
Row/input/business/source versions are separate. Terminal deals do not reopen;
compensation is separately authorized evidence. Manifest hashes cover all content,
recipient/account/terms/revision/expiry fields and are never authority by themselves.

Two contract additions remove otherwise undefined producer/consumer boundaries:
`GET /api/v1/auth/csrf` for pre-auth CSRF and GET/PATCH `/baseline` for dated opening
balance/coverage/evidence. P1/P3 must extend existing business/auth infrastructure
for them; no replacement accounting/identity system. Resource creation DTOs exclude
server-assigned offer/constraint IDs; confirmed snapshots retain actual IDs/versions.

Secret-bearing request fingerprints use a keyed digest because Pydantic redacts
password/account JSON; hashing that mask would treat different credentials as equal.
Auth response caches must not store raw session tokens. Auth-only lost-cookie
recovery requires explicit fresh sign-in, while financial commands retain exact
same-key replay. This exception is specified in the contract guide, not left to P1
to invent. Password step-up remains distinct from MFA.

OpenAI is the sole selected LLM provider. Official Responses structured-output
documentation was checked and the installed SDK exposes `responses.parse` with
`text_format` (local signature inspection, synthetic key, no network request).
There is no hardcoded model or price. P4 selects/evaluates a configured model and
implements off/recorded/live behavior; P0 does not claim those provider paths work.

### Checks actually executed

Local Python: CPython 3.12.13; Docker build uses CPython 3.12.15. Commands below are
from `backend/` unless a different directory is shown. A workspace-local uv cache
was used because the default cache was inaccessible. Initial dependency network
access was sandbox-blocked; approved download access resolved it. No approval was
rejected, and no dependency-install failure was reported as a pass.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `uv sync --frozen --extra dev --offline` after lock generation | Passed; reproducible local install, no lock update during frozen sync |
| `uv run --frozen --offline ruff check .` | Passed |
| `uv run --frozen --offline python -m orderfit.contracts.export --check` | Passed; 101 operations; generated artifacts match code |
| `uv run --frozen --offline pytest tests/contracts tests/test_architecture.py tests/engine tests/agent -q` | 84 passed; 81 new contract cases plus three original architecture tests. Existing engine/agent files are test scaffolds, not evidence of engine/agent completion |
| `openapi-spec-validator ../docs/contracts/openapi.json` and validator inside contract test | Passed; all component schemas also checked with JSON Schema validator; local refs resolve |
| TypeScript 5.9.3 from existing frontend lock: `tsc --strict --noEmit docs/contracts/frontend-api.d.ts docs/contracts/typecheck.ts` (repo root) | Passed, including declaration checking; generated money/ID/header/what-if types include checked invalid examples |
| `python ../docs/architecture/orderfit/fixtures/reference_engine.py --check` | Passed: 22 cases, zero problems, `ref-0.1.0`; expected files unchanged |
| `python ../docs/architecture/orderfit/fixtures/selftest.py` | Passed: zero failures, independent sweep/rounding/scenario/reference checks |
| `docker compose --env-file .env.example config --quiet` (repo root) | Passed, exit 0; default Docker config read warned about permissions; no resolved secrets printed |
| `docker build --tag orderfit-api:p0-contract-check ./backend` | Passed with final pinned build constraints; image `d90e57fd654e` |
| `docker run --rm --network none --entrypoint python orderfit-api:p0-contract-check ...` | Passed: UID 10001, installed API imports, only `/health` mounted, network disabled; no DB/provider connection |
| `git diff --check` | Passed; migration directory unchanged and both environment files absent from tracked index |
| Environment handling | Both local files preserved byte-for-byte; values were not printed; only key names/classifications inspected |

Initial Docker daemon inspection was sandbox-denied; approved build access
succeeded. An empty DOCKER_CONFIG hid this machine's installed Compose plugin;
the actual template validation was repeated with its normal plugin discovery and
returned exit 0 (config-read warnings only). Neither failed probe is deployment
evidence. The image build and non-root smoke checks above were actually completed.

The contract tests cover canonical money/IDs, all four currencies, dates, strict
booleans, unknown/missing fields, unsupported loans/policies, overflow/work/horizon,
source identity/role, revision conflicts, exact bundle hash sensitivity, canonical
goldens, permissions/state seed parity, idempotency fingerprints, Argon2id, safe
configuration, OpenAPI/type drift and health-only runtime behavior. They do not
stand in for database concurrency, source parsing or provider tests.

### Acceptance gate and unresolved work

**P0 acceptance gate passed.** Executable valid/invalid/stale/missing examples, complete target DTOs and
generated frontend types, capability -> endpoint/service/storage/test-gate mapping,
all 30 database dispositions and explicit financial semantics are present and
verified by the checks above, including final image build/smoke. The requested
commit is `feat(backend): freeze P0 contracts and lock dependencies`; its SHA is
available in Git history. No P1 implementation was started.

Credential-bearing database URLs existed in tracked environment files. Local
copies were preserved; owner rotation/revocation of historical credentials is
required and unverified. Untracking does not revoke repository-history exposure.
No configured database or provider was contacted to test credential validity.

Not run/claimed: PostgreSQL migrations/schema/concurrency/runtime-login/RLS tests;
actual auth/jobs/storage/restart/restore; running Compose stack; frontend browser
journey/full frontend build; hosted PostgreSQL/Neon; live OpenAI extraction/quality;
remote CI. These are later phase gates, not simulated passes. Docker image success
and liveness import are not a persisted business operation or running deployment.
The image's Python base tag remains a mutable deployment input; P8 must pin and
validate deployment artifacts if bit-for-bit deployment reproducibility is claimed.

### What P1 requires (not started)

1. Re-read current instructions/plan/contracts and inspect actual populated 0001
   data. Add manual forward foundation migrations without modifying applied SQL:
   sessions/provisioning, operation leases/fencing, snapshots and revisions, required
   compatibility/priority/tolerance/transition fixes and narrow privileges.
2. Match SQL with repository/Core mappings and scoped transaction factory. Verify
   real non-owner API/worker LOGIN roles, no admin/owner fallback and no pool leak.
3. Implement real password/session/CSRF/business selection/current membership,
   restricted owner provisioning, central errors, durable idempotency and PostgreSQL
   audit adapter. Wire RuntimeConfiguration into startup; no demo identity auth.
4. Establish separate API/worker operations, claim/restart/fencing and private
   document storage interface; do not implement P2 engine or P4 provider yet.
5. On an explicitly disposable PostgreSQL 17 target, pass clean and populated-0001
   upgrades, original SQL/concurrency suites, actual-runtime two-user/two-business,
   no-context/pool, membership revocation, idempotency and worker recovery gates.
